**Project 1: Responsive Website**
**U3203200**

**Reflection:**
This project has been quite the challenge for me, as it was my first time coding a website. I had no prior experience using css or html, so learning this language was interesting. My website came out better than I had initially expected, and I added in more lo-fi prototype ideas than I thought I would be able to. The things I believe I did well was adding lots of images into the website as per the Canberra Modern suggestion and catering to the needs of the client by providing most of the elements they asked for (upcoming events, images, about us, contact, social media). Although images were added, they still felt quite plain, and in future I would like to expand more on my knowledge of image altering to make the pictures selected more engaging to the audience, perhaps by exploring Java Script. One of the major issues I came across whilst coding my website was aligning images in columns. I struggled with this, and eventually sought out help from others to solve this issue. Adding the responsive element to my website was easier than initially thought, with my only struggle being my ‘upcoming events’ section on the landing page and making that area responsive. If I were to attempt this project again, I would be more conscious of time. I did not give myself enough time in this assessment to complete it to the high standard I had initially planned, and this time-constraint has affected my final product. 


**Lo-fi Prototypes**
*(found in 11056 website folder)*
My lo-fi prototypes were similar to my final website, with changes occurring in the ‘about us’ page. I added more information to the ‘about us’ page as it felt too small and did not contain enough information about Canberra Modern. I stuck to the design of my lo-fi prototypes, aside from some small elements, as I liked the style I had created, and it made it easier to code as a beginner by working off of a reference of the elements I wanted to include. 

**Resources used:**
My main resource that I used to assist in creating my website was 'W3Schools'. This website explained everything in easy to understand language, and had examples to view what the final code should look like.

I also used question forums, such as 'StackOverflow’ to research problems I was experiencing, and try solutions that others had posted.
